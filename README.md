For this homework, we used The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
